# MessagesPage
Just a website(named Johnson Timeline) that can display previous messages and create new messages. Personalized a little bit with custom animations.

To setup, make sure Node.js and MongoDB is installed.

Starting Server: 
1) Go to the server directory.
2) type npm start
3) The site should be sending and receiving messages now when the color.html file is opened
